# Food Festival
## Module 19 Project

## Description
 The app is called Food Festival, and the client is looking for help with two main blockers. First, their application is not deployed. That's obviously a major problem—because no one can use the app!—but it's also an easy fix. Second, the application loads very slowly when the client simulates a 4G internet connection using Chrome DevTools. The client needs a fast and performant application, especially on mobile, because the app is designed for event attendees who will be using it on their phones.
